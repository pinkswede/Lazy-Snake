About:

Lazy snake is a recreation of the nokia game 'snake' which involves a snake eating food,
after which its tail will increase in length. Once the snake reaches a certan length, the player
will win (5000 points achieved). If the player collides with either the walls, or with the snakes
tail, they will lose.

Understanding Code:

The code was organised into 7 different parts which perform certain types of funtions.

Main.cpp: initializes the title screen, handles game screens and runs game loop
Resources.cpp: Loads and Unloads both sound and textures
GameLevel.cpp: controls many aspects of the game logic
Resources.h: contains structures for the textures and sound
GameLevel.h: storage of variables, initialization of variables
Entity.h: decleration of game entities, common features grouped
Game.h: contains screens declerations and handles game level
myMath.h: Taken from Galba for math-related purposes
